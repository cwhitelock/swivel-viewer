# What this HOWTO covers #

Briefly, there are three different ways to swivel through an online photo album:

  1. Using the Picasa Web Albums built-in slideshow viewer
  1. Using the Picasa Web Albums embeddable (flash) slideshow viewer on another site
  1. Downloading the code on this site and hosting it yourself

Read on to find out how to do each of these things.  (Or go directly to [HostingTheViewer](HostingTheViewer.md) if you're a techie and already know you want to host the viewer yourself.)

# What's the big deal with swiveling, anyway? #

The ability to swivel left and right in an album by dragging on the image doesn't give you any new fundamental abilities.  But it's a lot easier than clicking repeatedly on a "next" or "previous" arrow.

If you can also zoom in and out of the images using your scroll wheel, examining a set of images becomes a lot more intuitive.  **Note that currently, zooming is only supported by the downloadable viewer available here**.  The picasa-based options only support swiveling backward and forward through images.

This is particularly helpful if the images in a photo album are closely related in space, for example, if the images are of an object turning on a turntable.  But the images don't have to be related for swiveling to be useful.

# How can I make a swivel-able album? #

The easiest way is to visit [Picasa Web Albums](http://picasaweb.google.com) and simply upload a few photos into an album.  When you're viewing the album's page, click the slideshow button:

<img src='http://lh6.ggpht.com/_oXIW_jM0QDA/TC0-oPPUaKI/AAAAAAAASIw/fNCfVmVmDG4/s640/slideshow.png'></img>

That'll bring up the full-page slideshow viewer:

Drag left and right to flip forward and backward through the images.  If the album is public (or unlisted), you can send others the page location and then can see your album in the slideshow viewer as well.

# How can I embed an album in a web page of my own? #

If you're technically skilled, you can use the code on this site to host your own viewer for images stored locally or elsewhere on the internet.

If not, don't despair!  The Picasa embeddable slideshow also supports swiveling.

Use the Picasa Web Albums [instructions for embedding a slideshow](http://picasa.google.com/support/bin/answer.py?answer=66969) in a blog post or other page on the internet.

# What if I want to host the images and viewer myself? #

You've come to the right place.  Use the "downloads" tab at the top of this page to download a source archive with our Javascript swivel viewer, which you can use freely to serve up zoomable, swivel-able slideshows of images on your own site or elsewhere.

[HostingTheViewer](HostingTheViewer.md) has more complete info on how to serve up the viewer and images yourself.

# What if I want to take a lot of photos very easily? #

We experimented with free-standing motorized turntable cabinets that let us securely mount lights, cameras and a laptop to control everything.  It's very experimental, but check out the [MakingSwivelAlbums](MakingSwivelAlbums.md) page for more info if you think you'd like to build a high volume photography cabinet.
