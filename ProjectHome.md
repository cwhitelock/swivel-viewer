This site hosts source code for an embeddable Javascript album viewer that allows viewers to drag left and right on an image to flip to the next or previous image in the album, or scroll the scroll wheel to zoom.  See the [HOWTO](HOWTO.md) for more details.

(We can't actually embed a viewer on code.google.com wikipages, but **click the image below** to see a page with an embedded viewer)
